    "# Exercise 5 - Variational quantum eigensolver\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical background\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last decade, quantum computers matured quickly and began to realize Feynman's initial dream of a computing system that could simulate the laws of nature in a quantum way. A 2014 paper first authored by Alberto Peruzzo introduced the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**, an algorithm meant for finding the ground state energy (lowest energy) of a molecule, with much shallower circuits than other approaches.[1] And, in 2017, the IBM Quantum team used the VQE algorithm to simulate the ground state energy of the lithium hydride molecule.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE's magic comes from outsourcing some of the problem's processing workload to a classical computer. The algorithm starts with a parameterized quantum circuit called an ansatz (a best guess) then finds the optimal parameters for this circuit using a classical optimizer. The VQE's advantage over classical algorithms comes from the fact that a quantum processing unit can represent and store the problem's exact wavefunction, an exponentially hard problem for a classical computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise 5 allows you to realize Feynman's dream yourself, setting up a variational quantum eigensolver to determine the ground state and the energy of a molecule. This is interesting because the ground state can be used to calculate various molecular properties, for instance the exact forces on nuclei than can serve to run molecular dynamics simulations to explore what happens in chemical systems with time.[3]\n",

    "\n",
    "For the implementation of VQE, you will be able to make choices on how you want to compose your simulation, in particular focusing on the ansatz quantum circuits.\n",
    "This is motivated by the fact that one of the important tasks when running VQE on noisy quantum computers is to reduce the loss of fidelity (which introduces errors) by finding the most compact quantum circuit capable of representing the ground state.\n",
    "Practically, this entails to minimizing the number of two-qubit gates (e.g. CNOTs) while not loosing accuracy.\n",

    "The core idea hybrid quantum-classical approach is to outsource to **CPU (classical processing unit)** and **QPU (quantum processing unit)** the parts that they can do best. The CPU takes care of listing the terms that need to be measured to compute the energy and also optimizing the circuit parameters. The QPU implements a quantum circuit representing the quantum state of a system and measures the energy. Some more details are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU** can compute efficiently the energies associated to electron hopping and interactions (one-/two-body integrals by means of a Hartree-Fock calculation) that serve to represent the total energy operator, Hamiltonian. The [Hartree–Fock (HF) method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method#:~:text=In%20computational%20physics%20and%20chemistry,system%20in%20a%20stationary%20state.) efficiently computes an approximate grounds state wavefunction by assuming that the latter can be represented by a single Slater determinant (e.g. for H$_2$ molecule in STO-3G basis with 4 spin-orbitals and qubits, $|\\Psi_{HF} \\rangle = |0101 \\rangle$ where electrons occupy the lowest energy spin-orbitals). What QPU does later in VQE is finding a quantum state (corresponding circuit and its parameters) that can also represent other states associated missing electronic correlations (i.e. $\\sum_i c_i |i\\rangle$ states in  $|\\Psi \\rangle = c_{HF}|\\Psi_{HF} \\rangle + \\sum_i c_i |i\\rangle $ where $i$ is a bitstring). \n",
    "\n",
    "After a HF calculation, operators in the Hamiltonian are mapped to measurements on a QPU using fermion-to-qubit transformations (see Hamiltonian section below). One can further analyze the properties of the system to reduce the number of qubits or shorten the ansatz circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Z2 symmetries and two-qubit reduction, see [Bravyi *et al*, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08213v1).\n",
    "- For entanglement forging, see [Eddins *et al.*, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10220v1).\n",
    "- For the adaptive ansatz see, [Grimsley *et al.*,2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11173v2), [Rattew *et al.*,2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09694), [Tang *et al.*,2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10205). You may use the ideas found in those works to find ways to shorten the quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QPU** implements quantum circuits (see Ansatzes section below), parameterized by angles $\\vec\\theta$, that would represent the ground state wavefunction by placing various single qubit rotations and entanglers (e.g. two-qubit gates). The quantum advantage lies in the fact that QPU can efficiently represent and store the exact wavefunction, which becomes intractable on a classical computer for systems that have more than a few atoms.  Finally, QPU measures the operators of choice (e.g. ones representing a Hamiltonian).\n",

    "### Hamiltonian \n",

    "$$\n",
    "g_{p q r s}=\\int \\frac{\\phi_{p}^{*}\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\phi_{q}^{*}\\left(r_{2}\\right) \\phi_{r}\\left(r_{2}\\right) \\phi_{s}\\left(r_{1}\\right)}{\\left|r_{1}-r_{2}\\right|} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $h_{r s}$  and $g_{p q r s}$ are the one-/two-body integrals (using the Hartree-Fock method) and $E_{N N}$ the nuclear repulsion energy. \n",
    "The one-body integrals represent the kinetic energy of the electrons and their interaction with nuclei. \n",
    "The two-body integrals represent the electron-electron interaction.\n",
    "The $\\hat{a}_{r}^{\\dagger}, \\hat{a}_{r}$ operators represent creation and annihilation of electron in spin-orbital $r$ and require mappings to operators, so that we can measure them on a quantum computer.\n",
    "Note that VQE minimizes the electronic energy so you have to retrieve and add the nuclear repulsion energy $E_{NN}$ to compute the total energy. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for every non-zero matrix element in the $ h_{r s}$ and $g_{p q r s}$ tensors, we can construct corresponding Pauli string (tensor product of Pauli operators) with the following fermion-to-qubit transformation. \n",
    "For instance, in Jordan-Wigner mapping for an orbital $r = 3$, we obtain the following Pauli string:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat a_{3}^{\\dagger}= \\hat \\sigma_z \\otimes \\hat \\sigma_z \\otimes\\left(\\frac{ \\hat \\sigma_x-i \\hat \\sigma_y}{2}\\right) \\otimes 1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\hat \\sigma_x, \\hat \\sigma_y, \\hat \\sigma_z$ are the well-known Pauli operators. The tensor products of $\\hat \\sigma_z$ operators are placed to enforce the fermionic anti-commutation relations.\n",

    "Then, one simply replaces the one-/two-body excitations (e.g. $\\hat{a}_{r}^{\\dagger} \\hat{a}_{s}$, $\\hat{a}_{p}^{\\dagger} \\hat{a}_{q}^{\\dagger} \\hat{a}_{r} \\hat{a}_{s}$) in the Hamiltonian by corresponding Pauli strings (i.e. $\\hat{P}_i$, see picture above). The resulting operator set is ready to be measured on the QPU.\n",

    "### Ansatzes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly 2 types of ansatzes you can use for chemical problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **q-UCC ansatzes** are physically inspired, and roughly map the electron excitations to quantum circuits. The q-UCCSD ansatz (`UCCSD`in Qiskit) possess all possible single and double electron excitations. The paired double q-pUCCD (`PUCCD`) and singlet q-UCCD0 (`SUCCD`) just consider a subset of such excitations (meaning significantly shorter circuits) and have proved to provide good results for dissociation profiles. For instance, q-pUCCD doesn't have single excitations and the double excitations are paired as in the image below.\n",
    "- **Heuristic ansatzes (`TwoLocal`)** were invented to shorten the circuit depth but still be able to represent the ground state. \n",
    "As in the figure below, the R gates represent the parametrized single qubit rotations and $U_{CNOT}$ the entanglers (two-qubit gates). The idea is that after repeating certain $D$-times the same block (with independent parameters) one can reach the ground state. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional details refer to [Sokolov *et al.* (q-UCC ansatzes)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10864v2) and [Barkoutsos *et al.* (Heuristic ansatzes)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04340.pdf).\n",

    "### VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Hermitian operator $\\hat H$ with an unknown minimum eigenvalue $E_{min}$, associated with the eigenstate $|\\psi_{min}\\rangle$, VQE provides an estimate $E_{\\theta}$, bounded by $E_{min}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    E_{min} \\le E_{\\theta} \\equiv \\langle \\psi(\\theta) |\\hat H|\\psi(\\theta) \\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$ is the trial state associated with $E_{\\theta}$. By applying a parameterized circuit, represented by $U(\\theta)$, to some arbitrary starting state $|\\psi\\rangle$, the algorithm obtains an estimate $U(\\theta)|\\psi\\rangle \\equiv |\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$ on $|\\psi_{min}\\rangle$. The estimate is iteratively optimized by a classical optimizer by changing the parameter $\\theta$ and minimizing the expectation value of $\\langle \\psi(\\theta) |\\hat H|\\psi(\\theta) \\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As applications of VQE, there are possibilities in molecular dynamics simulations, see [Sokolov *et al.*, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08144v1), and excited states calculations, see [Ollitrault *et al.*, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12890) to name a few.\n",
